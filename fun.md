# Interactive Dashboard on Forestry Database ðŸŒ³

I spent a summer playing with forestry data in [Dr. McConville's](http:///mcconville.rbind.io/){:target="_blank"} lab in 2022. Part of our project is to establish an evaluation system on the quality of different variance estimators and to improve data interpretability. Hence, I built an [interactive dashboard](https://kocyw6-jshang021.shinyapps.io/ShinyApps/){:target="_blank"} upon a carbon dataset from the [Forestry Inventory and Analysis](https://www.fia.fs.usda.gov/){:target="_blank"} program of the U.S. Forest Service, in the hope that we could help potential users understand the impact of forest practices and provide them with the extent of estimation uncertainty.

# Jing Shang

Hi, my name is Jing. I'm a first-year PhD student @[Stanford Statistics](https://statistics.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"}. I'm broadly interested in causal inference and its application in various fields. Additionally, I'm also interested in studying problems in applied probability.

Prior to Stanford, I received [Bachelor of Economics](https://econ.fudan.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"} from [Fudan Univerisity](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"} ('23).

# Jing Shang

Hi, my name is Jing. I'm a third-year PhD student @[Stanford Statistics](https://statistics.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"}. I am broadly interested in statistical methodology research, as well as data-driven decision making. For methodology, I develop tools for high dimensional problems and derive theoretical results for statistical inference. For decision making, I seek advancements in economics, biology, and engineering through the use of machine learning.


Prior to Stanford, I received [Bachelor of Economics](https://econ.fudan.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"} from [Fudan Univerisity](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"} ('23).

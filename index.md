# Jing Shang

Hi, my name is Jing. I'm a first-year PhD student @Stanford Statistics. I'm broadly interested in causal inference and its application in various fields. Additionally, I'm also interested in studying problems in applied probability.

Prior to Stanford, I received [Bachelor of Economics](econ.fudan.edu.cn) from [Fudan Univerisity](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/) ('23).

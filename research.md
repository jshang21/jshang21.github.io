Research on Variance Estimator for Ratio and Interactive Dashboard Development
Advisor: Professor Kelly McConville, Department of Statistics, Harvard University
·   Studied various variance estimators that can accommodate different sampling inclusion probability for estimators of ratio, including Linear Horvitz-Thompson, Linear Hájek-Berger, and Linear Hansen-Hurwitz variance estimators, incorporated the function of implementing these variance estimators into R package mase
·   Collaborated with Forest Inventory and Analysis group of the USDA to conduct statistical inference for ratio by implementing variance estimation on a forestry carbon dataset
·   Developed a two-dimensional grading system for the quality of estimation by taking both the precision metric of the estimates and the quality of samples into consideration
·   Developed an interactive R Shiny dashboard, which enables users to compare the cumulative carbon amount resulted from the intended forestry management activities and the baseline scenario, informs users of quantified uncertainty from sampling, and visualizes the multi-dimensional forestry carbon dataset
